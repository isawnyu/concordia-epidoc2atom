    <summary type="text">'Agora Gate', at the east end of the South Agora. i., ii. and iii are all
        cut, clearly set out as a group, on the façade, on the highest remaining course of blocks,
        which was capped above by a moulded course. i. is cut on the northernmost of a series of
        projecting bastions; ii. is on the next bastion to the south, whose surface is largely lost;
        three loose fragments were found in 1983. The third bastion shows no sign of any
        inscription; iii. is cut on the fourth. i. and ii. are on a smooth face, but iii. is cut
        partly on a rough surface. Date: Mid fifth century (titulature). Photos. Excavated in 1980
        by the NYU expedition (80.28, 80.29 and 80.53). Published by Roueché, Aphrodisias in Late
